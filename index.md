#### Virus Simulator 
Independently packaged virus simulator used to better help people understand the spread of disease. It includes such variables as infectiousness, death and recovery rates, and population size. The color of the virus changes based on infectiousness for a better visual aid, uninfected humans are yellow, recovered humans are white, and the deceased are represented by red X’s. Once initiated, the virus will run its course through the population until one of three outcomes: 1) The virus kills everyone, 2) Everyone in the population is dead or has recovered from the virus, or 3) The virus is wiped out before some of the population are ever infected. Written entirely in Java, this simulation provides a visual experience to ideas such as herd immunity, r0s, and has the potential for so much more.
